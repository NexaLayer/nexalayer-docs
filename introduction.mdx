---

# Introduction

NexaLayer is an **API-first network execution layer** that sits between AI Agents and proxy infrastructure. It exposes session-based abstraction over dynamic and static proxies so agents can operate globally without managing raw IP pools.

## What NexaLayer provides

- **Session abstraction** — Create, rotate, renew, and terminate proxy sessions via a single API.
- **Unified interface** — One API for both dynamic (rotating) and static (fixed-IP) proxies.
- **Agent-first design** — Authentication (API Key or JWT), idempotency, rate-limit headers, and telemetry for autonomous workflows.
- **Self-service** — Register, recharge, and manage sessions without a human dashboard (dashboard optional).

## Base URL

All API requests use:

```
https://api.nexalayer.net/v1
```

## Core concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Agent** | An app registered via `POST /account/register`. Identified by `api_key` (and optionally `api_secret` for JWT). |
| **Session** | A proxy usage session. Has `session_id`, `type` (dynamic/static), `status`, and `proxy` (host, port, credentials). |
| **Telemetry** | Event reporting (success, http_error, captcha, timeout, block) to track session health and drive rotation advice. |

## Document structure

- **Getting started** — Quickstart, authentication, accounts.
- **Products** — List products, regions, and recommendations.
- **Sessions** — Create (dynamic/static), rotate, renew, terminate.
- **Billing** — Balance, recharge, transactions.
- **Telemetry** — Report events, batch report, session health.
- **Stats & Errors** — Overview stats, error codes, retry guidance.
- **Practices** — Best practices for sessions and security.
- **Architecture** — System design and backend integration.
- **Testing** — Smoke, integration, and E2E test design.
