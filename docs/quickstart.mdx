## 1. Register

Create an account and get an API key:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.nexalayer.com/v1/account/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "My Agent", "contact_email": "dev@example.com"}'
```

Save the returned `api_key`; it is used for all subsequent requests.

## 2. Create a session

Create a dynamic proxy session:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.nexalayer.com/v1/sessions \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "dynamic",
    "config": {
      "product_no": "out_dynamic_1",
      "traffic_gb": 1,
      "protocol": "http",
      "country": "US"
    }
  }'
```

Response includes `session_id`, `status`, and `proxy_config` (host, port, credentials).

## 3. Send traffic

Use the session’s proxy configuration (e.g. `http://user:pass@host:port`) in your HTTP client to send requests through the proxy. Rotate when needed:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.nexalayer.com/v1/sessions/SESSION_ID/rotate \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## SDK

Use the official SDKs for a higher-level client and session abstraction:

- [Python SDK](https://github.com/NexaLayer/nexalayer-sdk#python)
- [Node SDK](https://github.com/NexaLayer/nexalayer-sdk#node)
