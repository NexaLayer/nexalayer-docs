title: Renew session
description: Renew or extend a session.

Renewal behavior depends on the product:

- **Dynamic**: Typically no “renew” — add traffic or create a new session.
- **Static**: Extend the rental period via billing or a dedicated renew endpoint (if offered).

Check the [Products](/products/list-products) and [Billing](/billing/balance) docs for how to add traffic or extend duration. If your product supports an explicit renew API, it will be documented in the API reference.
