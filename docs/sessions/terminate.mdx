# Terminate session

Call `POST /sessions/{session_id}/terminate` to end a session. The session will no longer be usable; remaining traffic or time is forfeited according to product terms.

## Request

<CodeGroup>

```bash Request
curl -X POST "https://agent-layer.up.railway.app/v1/sessions/sess_a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890/terminate" \
  -H "X-API-Key: <api_key>"
```

```json Response
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "session_id": "sess_a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890",
    "status": "terminated",
    "terminated_at": "2026-02-15T11:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Subsequent `GET /sessions/{session_id}` will show `status: "terminated"`. Terminate sessions when done to free quota and avoid unnecessary cost.
