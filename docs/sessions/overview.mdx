title: Sessions overview
description: Session-based proxy abstraction for dynamic and static proxies.
---

Sessions are the core abstraction in NexaLayer. A **session** represents a proxy configuration (dynamic or static) that you use to send outbound traffic.

## Session types

| Type     | Description                          |
|----------|--------------------------------------|
| Dynamic  | On-demand IPs; pay per traffic (GB). |
| Static   | Reserved IPs; pay per duration.      |

## Lifecycle

1. **Create** — `POST /sessions` with `type` and `config`.
2. **Use** — Send HTTP requests through the session’s proxy config.
3. **Rotate** — `POST /sessions/{session_id}/rotate` to get a new IP (dynamic).
4. **Renew** — Extend or renew as per product (see [Renew](/sessions/renew)).
5. **Terminate** — Release the session when done (see [Terminate](/sessions/terminate)).

## Endpoints

- `POST /sessions` — Create session
- `GET /sessions/{session_id}` — Get session details
- `POST /sessions/{session_id}/rotate` — Rotate IP
- `GET /sessions/{session_id}/usage` — Usage for the session
