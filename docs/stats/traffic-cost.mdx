- **Dynamic sessions**: Billed per GB (or MB) of traffic; see product pricing and session usage.
- **Static sessions**: Billed by duration (e.g. per month) and possibly bandwidth caps.

Cost per session is available from:

- `GET /sessions/{session_id}/usage` — per-session usage and cost (if returned).
- `GET /stats/overview` — account-level totals.

Traffic is measured at the proxy egress. Check product and billing docs for exact units and currency.
