# Products

NexaLayer exposes two product types: **dynamic** (rotating IP, pay per traffic) and **static** (fixed IP, pay per duration). Use the product API to list available products and get recommendations before creating sessions.

## Product types

| Type | Description | Billing |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Dynamic | Rotating IPs; suitable for scraping, data collection | Per traffic (GB) |
| Static | Fixed IPs; suitable for account management, SEO monitoring | Per duration (e.g. 30/90 days) |
