description: API Key, Secret, and Bearer token authentication.

NexaLayer supports two authentication modes.

## Option 1: API Key (direct)

Send your API key on every request:

```
X-API-Key: your-api-key
```

No token exchange required. Best for quickstart and server-side scripts.

## Option 2: Bearer token (via token exchange)

1. Obtain a short-lived token:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.nexalayer.com/v1/auth/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY", "api_secret": "YOUR_API_SECRET"}'
```

2. Use the returned `access_token` in the header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

Use this when you need token expiry and refresh semantics (e.g. OAuth-style flows).

## Security

- Do not commit API keys or secrets to source control.
- Prefer environment variables or a secret manager.
- Rotate keys periodically; revoke compromised keys in the dashboard.
